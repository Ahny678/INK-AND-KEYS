# Ink & Keys — Hackathon Raw Log

## 2025-08-12 history
I am participating in a hackathon and want to build a Productivity & Workflow Tool for writers. The name is Ink & Keys

Core MVP: Users can upload handwritten notes (images or scans) → the backend processes them with OpenCV + Tesseract → outputs editable text in a rich text editor with autosave.

 Later, I’ll add chapter metadata, image annotations, and timelines, but for now I just want the MVP first.

Tech Stack Requirements:

Frontend: React (TypeScript) for UI

Backend: NestJS (TypeScript) for API and OCR processing

Single repo containing both frontend and backend, with a clean folder structure

Communication: React should call NestJS API endpoints for authentication, file upload, and OCR text retrieval

Authentication: JWT-based login, register, logout (NestJS + frontend integration)

Database: PostgreSQL (with Prisma ORM)

Dockerized project so anyone can pull and run the app easily (Docker Compose to run React, NestJS, and Postgres together)

What I need from you right now:

A complete steering file for the MVP and planned add-ons, with a clear breakdown of each feature and when to build it.

A project.md file that documents project goals, stack choice, and the build plan.

A detailed to-do list in logical build order, so I don’t get lost. This should include setting up the repo, linking frontend-backend, creating models, OCR integration, and adding the editor.

List all required models for MVP (and any future add-ons, marked separately). Include fields, types, and relationships.

Generate boilerplate code for a monorepo that has:

/frontend → React app (with TypeScript and base pages for auth + dashboard)

/backend → NestJS app (with TypeScript, Prisma, and auth endpoints)

/docker setup (Dockerfile for frontend, backend, and docker-compose.yml to run Postgres + apps together)

Ensure the backend has an OCR processing service placeholder where I can later integrate OpenCV + Tesseract.

Add placeholder API routes for:

User auth (register, login, logout)

File upload for OCR

Get processed text

Instructions for file creation:

Generate all files directly in the correct repo folders for the monorepo setup. 

Explain the folder structure in detail and how React and NestJS will communicate.

Ensure the code is ready to run with docker-compose up after cloning.

Once you give me this, I will then come back to you for step-by-step implementation of each item in the to-do list.

I see you're working on a task that's optimized for spec sessions. Would you like to start a dedicated spec session for the best experience?

Yes

I'll help you create a comprehensive spec for your Ink & Keys productivity tool. Let me start by creating the requirements document based on your hackathon project idea.

Created

requirements.md


Now let me ask for your review of these requirements before proceeding to the design phase.

Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design.

There is one misconception. Ink and Keys isnt solely for handwritten notes. Writers can also create a new chapter as a docx. They dont have to always upload a handwritten pdf. Its like google docs but withthe extra add on of handwritten to docs coversion. An example of a typical workplow: A writer types chatpers 1 to 10 in the usual manner of creating new document etc. Then they upload the handwritten chapters 11 and 12

Thanks for that clarification! That's an important distinction - Ink & Keys is more like Google Docs with OCR capabilities rather than just an OCR tool. Let me update the requirements to reflect this broader document creation and management functionality.

Do the updated requirements look good now? If so, we can move on to the design.

Perfect! Now I'll create the design document based on these requirements. Let me research the technical architecture and create a comprehensive design.

Searched workspace
Researching NestJS JWT authentication patterns for the design
Searched workspace
Researching React TypeScript project structure patterns
Let me create the design document based on the requirements and best practices for the tech stack:

Created

design.md


Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan.

I want to add that i currently do not have funds. so i am not using any paid services for this project. both for the dev process and production. there are many services avaiable for free like vercel, render etc. and during production, the libraries or external apis used are all free right?

Great point! Let me update the design to reflect the constraint of using only free services and libraries. This is important for the hackathon context.

Does the updated design with free-tier considerations look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan.

Perfect! Now I'll create the implementation plan with detailed tasks for building the Ink & Keys application.

Created

tasks.md


Do the tasks look good?

Excellent! Your Ink & Keys spec is now complete with requirements, design, and implementation tasks.

What's Next
Your spec is ready for implementation! Here's how to proceed:

Start Implementation: Open the tasks.md file in .kiro/specs/ink-and-keys/tasks.md and click "Start task" next to any task item to begin implementation

Recommended Starting Point: Begin with Task 1 (project structure setup) as it establishes the foundation for everything else

Task Execution: I'll help you implement each task step-by-step, focusing on one task at a time to ensure quality and avoid overwhelming complexity

The spec includes:

✅ Requirements: 6 main requirements covering authentication, document management, OCR processing, rich text editing, dashboard, and system architecture
✅ Design: Comprehensive technical design with free-tier deployment strategy, data models, API interfaces, and security considerations
✅ Tasks: 16 detailed implementation tasks in logical build order, from project setup to deployment
All the planning is done with a focus on free services and open-source libraries, perfect for your hackathon project. When you're ready to start coding, just let me know which task you'd like to tackle first!

Great! The tests are now passing. Let me also verify that the application builds correctly:

Perfect! Now let me verify that the uploads directory is created and test the API endpoints by starting the server briefly:

Command
mkdir -p uploads
tiffany@NZYM-named-this:~/hackathon/InkAndKeys/backend$ 
Let me also verify that all the requirements from the task are met by checking the implementation:

Read file(s)

requirements.md 25 - 36
Perfect! Let me verify that all the requirements are met:

✅ Requirement 2.2: WHEN a user uploads an image file THEN the system SHALL accept common image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, PDF)

Implemented in multerConfig and FilesService.validateFile() with allowed mime types: image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/png, application/pdf
✅ Requirement 2.3: WHEN a user uploads a file larger than 10MB THEN the system SHALL return a file size error

Implemented in both multerConfig (10MB limit) and FilesService.validateFile() with clear error message
✅ Requirement 2.4: WHEN a user uploads an invalid file type THEN the system SHALL return a file type error

Implemented in both multerConfig and FilesService.validateFile() with clear error message listing allowed types
✅ Requirement 2.5: WHEN a valid file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store the file securely and return a file reference

Implemented in FilesService.uploadFile() which stores files with unique names and returns file metadata
✅ Requirement 2.6: WHEN a file upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging to the user

Implemented with proper error handling and clear error messages in service and controller
✅ Requirement 2.7: WHEN a user creates or uploads content THEN the system SHALL associate it with their user account

Implemented by requiring authentication (@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)) and associating files with userId
Now let me update the task status to completed:

I have successfully implemented task 5: "Implement file upload and storage system". Here's what was accomplished:

✅ Task Components Completed:
File upload middleware with validation - Created multerConfig with file type and size validation
File service for secure file handling - Implemented FilesService with comprehensive file operations
File controller with upload endpoint - Created FilesController with REST endpoints for file operations
Multer configuration for multipart form data - Configured multer with proper limits and validation
Unit tests for file upload functionality - Created comprehensive tests for both service and controller
🔧 Key Features Implemented:
File Upload: POST /files/upload endpoint with drag-and-drop support
File Validation: Accepts PNG, JPG, JPEG, PDF files up to 10MB
Secure Storage: Files stored with unique names to prevent conflicts
User Association: All files are linked to authenticated users
File Management: Get, list, and delete file operations
Error Handling: Clear error messages for validation failures
Database Integration: File metadata stored in PostgreSQL via Prisma
📋 API Endpoints:
POST /files/upload - Upload file for OCR processing
GET /files - Get all user files
GET /files/:id - Get specific file details
DELETE /files/:id - Delete file and cleanup
✅ Requirements Satisfied:
All requirements 2.2 through 2.7 have been fully implemented with proper validation, error handling, and user authentication.

The file upload system is now ready and integrates seamlessly with the existing authentication system. The next task in the implementation plan would be task 6: "Build OCR processing service" which will use the uploaded files from this system.

Q & A

These files are being stored locally instead of a cloud. Is this because we are extracting text from the file after upload? thus, there is no need for a cloud provider. The text extracted would be eventually stored in the database right? How is the text for these chapters .docx going to be stored

Kiro
You're absolutely right to question this! Let me examine the design and requirements to clarify the file storage strategy.

Read file(s)

design.md

requirements.md

schema.prisma
You're absolutely correct! Looking at the design and requirements, I can see the intended workflow:

Current Implementation vs. Intended Design
The Workflow Should Be:
File Upload → Store temporarily for processing
OCR Processing → Extract text from the uploaded file
Document Creation → Store extracted text in the Document table
File Cleanup → Delete the original file after successful OCR
Current Issues with Local Storage:
You're right to question this! The current implementation has several problems:

Persistent Local Storage: Files are stored permanently in /uploads directory
No Cleanup: Files accumulate without being deleted after OCR processing
Deployment Issues: Local file storage doesn't work well with containerized deployments
Storage Limits: Free tier platforms have limited ephemeral storage
How Text Should Be Stored:
Looking at the schema, the extracted text should be stored in the Document table:

content field stores the extracted text
documentType is set to OCR_PROCESSED
originalFileName stores the original file name for reference
The UploadedFile record tracks processing status but the file itself should be temporary
Recommended Fix:
The file storage should be temporary with automatic cleanup:

Accepted edits to

files.service.ts


The Complete Workflow Should Be:
Upload → File stored temporarily in /uploads with status UPLOADED
OCR Processing → Status changes to PROCESSING, then PROCESSED
Document Creation → Extracted text stored in Document.content
File Cleanup → Original file deleted, UploadedFile record kept for audit
Why This Approach:
Storage Efficiency: Only text is stored permanently, not large image files
Deployment Friendly: Works with ephemeral storage on free tiers
Cost Effective: Minimizes storage usage
Audit Trail: UploadedFile records track what was processed
The next task (OCR processing) should implement this cleanup workflow when it creates the document from extracted text. The current file upload implementation is correct for the temporary storage part - it just needs the cleanup logic that will be triggered by the OCR service.

Would you like me to continue with the next task (OCR processing) which will complete this workflow?

A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited. This is likely caused by tests leaking 
due to improper teardown. Try running with --detectOpenHandles to find leaks. Active timers can also cause this, ensure that .unref() was called on them.
